Apple Store Apps Analysis And Exploration

Analyzing Apple Store app reviews and categories will help software eningeers and stakeholders develop apps that will be competative and have better reviews in the market. I was able to ask questions like what were the most popular apps, what affects user ratings, such as languages, and what categories of apps did the best in the market. 
After analyzing the data I found that:
1. Paid apps have better ratings. Users whp pay for an app may have higher engagement which leads to better ratings. Stakeholders should consider charging a certain amount.  
2. Apps supporting between 10 and 30 language have better ratings. Focus on the right lanaguages for the consumers.
3. Finance and books have the lowest ratings. This shows that the users of these kinds of apps are not having their needs meet. It's an opportunity to develop a better quality app that will  address those needs.
4. The longer app descriptions also have higher ratings. Users prefer an understanding of the app before using it.
5. Games and Entertainment have the highest number of apps. It is an oversaturated market, but may also suggest high user demand.
